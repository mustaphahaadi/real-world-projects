# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a popular framework for setting up React applications quickly and efficiently. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the application.

## Available Scripts

Once you have cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, you can run several commands to manage your application. Below are the available scripts:

### `npm start`Price Watcher

This command starts the application in development mode. After executing this command, you can open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

The development server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source code. Additionally, any linting errors will be displayed in the console, helping you maintain code quality.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. It allows you to run tests and see the results in real-time. For more information on how to write and run tests, refer to the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

When you are ready to deploy your application, use this command to compile the app for production. It creates an optimized build in the `build` folder. The build process includes:

- Bundling React in production mode.
- Optimizing the build for maximum performance.
- Minifying the output files and including unique hashes in the filenames for better caching.

After running this command, your application will be ready for deployment. For detailed deployment instructions, see the section on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Important Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert!**

If you find that the default build tool and configuration do not meet your needs, you can use this command to eject from the Create React App setup. This command will:

- Remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

After ejecting, all commands except `eject` will still function, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to modify them as needed. At this point, you will be responsible for maintaining your own configuration.

You are not required to use `eject`. The curated feature set provided by Create React App is suitable for small to medium deployments, and you should only consider ejecting if you need extensive customization.
